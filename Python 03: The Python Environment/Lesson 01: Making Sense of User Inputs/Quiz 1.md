**Question 1:**
Why should you not cut and paste the code when working in O'Reilly School of Technology courses?

**Your Answer:**
To get the feel of actually writing code and paying attention to e.g. indentation and syntax.

**Mentor Comments:**
Yes, and also working out at the console, trying stuff, actively engaging with the interpreter.

The original founder of OST was an accomplished calculus professor who decided after some  years in teaching that his techniques induced too much passivity at the price of deteriorating  student performance.  Reading and watching videos are also passive activities.  There's  nothing wrong with "passive" but a programmer is actively engaged in writing source code: that's what a programmer does.  So at OST we strongly encourage *doing* the core activity, which is typing while thinking about code, what it does, why it does.  The typing part is critical  because it gets you in the habit of actually doing the core physical activity that programming entails.  If this were a school about creative writing, we would be encouraging you to  write, write, write.  Not just read or cut and paste writings.

**Question 2:**
What is a working set?

**Your Answer:**
A working set is a view of the workspace which acts like a folder and allows grouping of related files together.  Unlike a folder it does not actually exist in the file system.

**Mentor Comments:**
Right. A working set is more like a collection of symbolic links (Linux) or hyperlinks (Windows).

**Question 3:**
What module and variable name contains command-line arguments?

**Your Answer:**
The sys module and specifically sys.argv gives you access to command line arguments.

**Mentor Comments:**
none

**Question 4:**
How often should you write tests for your code?

**Your Answer:**
You should write tests every time you add to or change the funtionality of the program you are testing.

**Mentor Comments:**
That's right. The stock answer for this is *ALWAYS* - testing is completely central to the development of high quality and robust code.

**Overall Comments:**
Hi Mark,

Welcome back. And welcome to Python 3.

You have what I hope will be a great experience in front of you.  We'll be covering topics such as regular expressions, "magic" methods, logging, and working with inheritance.

I'll be your guide / mentor through the process.  I am here to help you as much or as little as you like.  I'm always available to address you concerns, large or small.  You need only to ask.  I succeed and OST succeeds only when you do.

Here are a few tips that will maximize your learning experience:

- Do allow yourself to struggle a bit with the material - it's an effective way to internalize new material - but don't stay stuck for too long.   Feel free to ask for examples, amplification, clarification, or whatever you think will help you to master the information.

- The console window is your best friend - an interactive tutor on the nuances of the Python language.  Avail yourself of the help() and dir() functions to explore new objects. Try code fragments out as appropriate to explore their functionality.  You'll want to avoid the temptation to cut and paste lesson code - it's an important part of the process of absorption.

- Know you can't fail.  Know you can't break anything.  Relax.  Enjoy.

- And above all, have fun.

Looking forward to engaging with you again.

Best Regards,

-Pat
