**Question 1:**
Fundamentally, what do regular expressions do?

**Your Answer:**
Regular expressions describe text through pattern matching.

**Mentor Comments:**
Regular expressions, I think you realize, comprise their own "mini language" that gets embedded within other languages such as Perl, Ruby and Python. Perl programs are more likely to resort to regex use as a tool of first choice whereas Python in design is a bit more reticent, tucks them away in a module. Python's re library is quite capable, at least in this C-language incarnation that we're using.  You can study regex-language as a separate topic, independently of Python, much as you can study SQL.
