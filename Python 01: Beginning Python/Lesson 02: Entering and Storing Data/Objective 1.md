**Objective:**
This project tests your ability to perform simple string calculations.

Create a new Python source file named greeting.py.
Write code that uses two separate statements to ask the user for a first and last name, and then prints out an appropriate greeting.
Verify your program works correctly and hand it in.
Here is an example of how the program might appear when run:

Enter your first name: Steve
Enter your last name: Holden
I am pleased to meet you, Steve Holden

**Here are the files you handed in:**
python1Homework/greeting.py

**Overall Comments:**
 Very cool but your code seems a bit much. For more practice can you make the code more concise?
