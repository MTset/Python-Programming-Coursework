**Objective:**
This simple project is designed to remind you how to create and run a program, and to show how to submit homework projects. Go through the following steps, referring to the course notes if you get stuck.

Create a new file.
Enter the four lines of code shown in the editor window below:
Save the file (we recommend creating and using a folder for this and all of your homework separate from your /python1 folder with a recognizable name like /python1homework) as one_statement.py.
Run it to make sure it works properly.
Code to type into your Python source file:

"Simple one-statement module with docstring."
print("""This is a very simple program
that, when run, will verify I can create,
save, and run programs in CodeRunner.""")
When you finish, hand in your one_statement.py file by finding it in the folders at left below and dragging it to the Drop Here folder at right. Then, click Hand In (at the bottom right of the screen—you may need to scroll down to find it!) to submit it to the instructor.

**Here are the files you handed in:**
python1Homework/one_statement.py
