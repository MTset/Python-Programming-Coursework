**Objective:**
This project tests your basic ability to write, use, and understand custom functions.

Create a new Python source file named three_param.py.
Write a program that has a function named my_func with three parameters, 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The first parameter is required, and the second two parameters have the default values of 'b was not entered' and 'c was not entered'. The function must print the value of each parameter.
In your program, call my_func three times. The first time, just provide a value for the first parameter. The second time, provide values for the first and second parameters. The third time, provide values for all three parameters.
In your program, print the function itself.
Below is an example of possible output from running the program using the word 'test' as the value for all arguments provided to calls.

test
b was not entered
c was not entered
test
test
c was not entered
test
test
test
&lt;function my_func at 0x397588&gt;

**Overall Comments:**
 Hi Mark

Absolutely f***ing brilliant !!!  I believe you have the coolest project ever submitted for this objective in all of history!

All I can say is WOW!

And, if you don't mind, I'm going to show it to my thirteen-year-old boy who is just beginning to learn Python with the dream of creating a Homework Machine. This is an exemplar of such a thing. Way cool!

You made my day. Thanks.
