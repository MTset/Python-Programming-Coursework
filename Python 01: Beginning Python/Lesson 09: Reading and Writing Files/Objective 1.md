**Objective:**
This project tests your ability to use file objects.

Create a new Python source file named inputter.py.
Write a program that uses a while loop to accept input from the user (if the user presses Enter, exit the program).
Save the input to a file, then print it.
Upon starting, the program will display any previous content of the file.
Below is an example of possible output from a first run of the program.
