**Question #2:**
Where can you store an instantiated object?

**Answer #2:**
Instantiated objects, like all objects in Python (and everything in Python is an object) are stored in memory. The object can then be bound to the name of one or more variables in order that it can be accessed e.g.

&gt;&gt;&gt; class First:
... pass
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; first = First()
&gt;&gt;&gt; first
&lt;__main__.First object at 0x7f68d6618f60&gt;
