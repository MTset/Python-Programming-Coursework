**Objective:**
This project tests your ability to use for and while loops.

Create a new Python source file named guess.py.
Write a program that uses a while loop to ask the user to guess a number. Each guess should be checked against a number stored in the "secret" variable, to which a value between 1 and 20 should be assigned at the start. Otherwise it should report whether the guess was higher or lower than the secret. If the user guesses correctly, the loop should terminate. The loop should also keep a count of the user's guesses, and should terminate if the user makes five incorrect guesses. After the loop is over, the program should print the secret if the user didn't guess it, or a congratulatory message if the user guessed correctly.
Verify that your program works correctly, both when the user guesses correctly and when they make five incorrect guesses.
Below are two example outputs for the program when "secret" is 12.

Guess a number: 16
Guess lower
Guess a number: 8
Guess higher
Guess a number: 14
Guess lower
Guess a number: 10
Guess higher
Guess a number: 11
Sorry, the number was 12

Guess a number: 10
Guess higher
Guess a number: 15
Guess lower
Guess a number: 12
Correct! Well done, the number was 12
