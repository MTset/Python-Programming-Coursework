# Python-02:-Getting-More-Out-of-Python
O'Reilly School of Technology - Python Programming Certificate
--------------------------------------------------------------

In this course, we leaned more in-depth techniques and strategies for programming with Python. We got hands-on experience with Pythonâ€™s modular unit testing features; file handling, storage, and archival; graphical user interfaces; and technologies for working with databases and email. Upon completion of this online Python course I was able to:

* Demonstrate understanding of Agile processes and test-driven development.
* Manage files, persistent storage, archives, and serialization.
* Create a Graphical User Interface in Python.
* Design and implement relational databases using Python and SQL.
* Create and send emails from Python programs.
* Build a full-fledged Python database application.
