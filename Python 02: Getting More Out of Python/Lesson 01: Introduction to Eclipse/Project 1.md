Hi Mark,

You've aced your first Python 2 project.  Fear not, they'll get more challenging.

For future projects, you might consider including a header with your program.  The first line provides a "hash-bang" tag that indicates which version of Python your code was written against.  The rest provides a combination of documentation and "curb appeal", giving your code a professional look and feel.
