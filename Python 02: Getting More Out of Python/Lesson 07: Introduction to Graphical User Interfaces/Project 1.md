**Here are your instructions:**
Write a GUI-based program that provides two Entry fields, a button and a label. When the button is clicked, the value of each Entry should (if possible) be converted into a float. If both conversions succeed, the label should change to the sum of the two numbers. Otherwise it should read "***ERROR***."

Hi Pat,

Hi Mark,

Yes, the error message makes a lot more sense. FYI, if both inputs are wrong, it only flags the first one - that so trivial a point, I will not even bring it up :-) Overall, your project is awesome.
