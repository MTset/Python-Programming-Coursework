**Here are your instructions:**
Starting with the project you created at the end of the last lesson, add components to the existing framework so that:
Frame 3 should contain an Entry and a Text widget. When the button now labeled "Open" is clicked, the content of the Entry should be used as a file name, and the content of the file (if any) displayed in the Text widget.
The color of the text displayed in Frame 3's Text widget should change appropriately when the "Red," "Blue," "Green," or "Black" buttons are clicked.
