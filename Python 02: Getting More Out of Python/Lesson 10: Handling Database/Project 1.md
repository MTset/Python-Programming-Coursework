**Here are your instructions:**
Populate your database with "animal" and "food" tables using the tablepop and addfood programs that you wrote during the lesson (this step will not be necessary if you have not modified the tables since you created them in the lesson).

Write a program that verifies that every animal eats at least one food.

**Your Comment:**
Hi Pat,

As addenda to yesterday's email:

I have decided to restrict the project to one test, which should comply with your testing procedure
and I have added a small check in the case one tries to add food for an animal which is not there.

Cheers,

Mark
