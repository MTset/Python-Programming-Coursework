# Python-04:-Advanced-Python
O'Reilly School of Technology - Python Programming Certificate
--------------------------------------------------------------

In this course, we learned to incorporate further object-oriented design principles and techniques with the intention of rounding out our skill set. Techniques like recursion, composition, and delegation were explained and put into practice through the ever-present test-driven practical work. Upon completion of this course, I was able to:

* Extend Python code functionality through inheritance, complex delegation, and recursive composition.
* Publish, subscribe, and optimize my code.
* Create advanced class decorators and generators in Python.
* Demonstrate knowledge of Python introspection.
* Apply multi-threading and multiprocessing to Python development.
* Manage arithmetic contexts and memory mapping.
* Demonstrate understanding of the Python community, conferences, and job market.
* Develop a multiprocessing solution to a significant data processing problem.
