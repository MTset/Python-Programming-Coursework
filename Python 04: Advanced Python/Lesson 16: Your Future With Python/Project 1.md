Hi Kirby,

Thanks for the reminder, previous code ammended.  Leftover logic from first attempt.

Not sure if this will do, bu I submitted this code to StackOverflow at this link:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34278036/transforming-3-strings-into-3-sets/34278789#34278789

If my first effort was insufficient or inadequate, I have also submitted
the following
to StackOverflow, at this link:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34270970/find-location-of-a-number-in-a-list-python/34280394#34280394

By the way, I am "MTset" on there

Cheers,

Mark

**Overall Comments:**
Congratulations.

Helping others learn Python is like good code scouts ethics.

It's how we "pay it forward" given Python was a gift to us, for free.

Not that learning it doesn't take resources (time / energy), but the tool itself is 
freely downloadable and free and open i.e. counts as certified open source 
software).

Have great adventures with your newly developed skills.  May they continue
to develop and serve you well.
