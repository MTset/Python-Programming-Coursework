**Question 1:**
What is the largest Python conference in the world?

**Your Answer:**
PyCon

**Mentor Comments:**
Right.  Pycon is a Python Software Foundation owned trademark that means "Python Circus" and many conferences request / receive permission to use it.

EuroPython predates PyCon as an institution.  Both are still happening.  PyCons may happen in Europe too.

**Question 2:**
Do you have to know the C language to become a Python core contributor?

**Your Answer:**
No, though it helps :-), The standard library and its test suite have lots of code written entirely in Python, and it needs maintenance just like everything else.

**Mentor Comments:**
right, C is a fantastically useful language to know and I would not discourage studying the C implementation of Python -- what we have used throughout this course.

How to extend Python in C / C++ is outside the scope of this course but very feasible, done all the time e.g. with wxPython.

Also check out Cython a C / Python hybrid language that understands full Python syntax but "compiles" to C language source which in turn compiles to an importable module.

With Cython you may introduce static typing where necessary to vastly speed some operations.

**Question 3:**
What is a sprint?

**Your Answer:**
Sprints are focused efforts on getting some aspect of a project up and running, by a team that might be scattered around the world when not actually at the same conference. 

**Mentor Comments:**
built right in to SCRUM if you're into that project management mode

**Overall Comments:**
Excellent.  Congratulations.
