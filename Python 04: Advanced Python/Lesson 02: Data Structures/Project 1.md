Hi Mark,

You've come up with a really great solution. I completely encourage you to explore new Python objects, even if they are not covered in the course. Knows? You just might up with something that I can't figure out right away and will provide the opportunity to learn something cool and new.

You're completely awesome app has made my day :-)
