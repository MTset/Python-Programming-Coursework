Hi Mark,

Welcome to Python 4.   I look forward to sharing this journey with you.  You are off to a great start with a perfect quiz.

This is a challenging course - it will draw upon many aspects of Python, and perhaps programming in general, that you may not have seen in your previous career.  You will learn and accomplish much, but it will be a significant amount of work.

Here are a few tips, for your consideration:

- The console window is your best friend.  Use it extensively.  There, you can explore the "behind the scenes" aspects of the tools you'll be working with in a very safe "sandbox" environment.

- Use print statements extensively to help you understand how your code is operating; you don't have to guess.

- Read the lessons very thoroughly; often the clues to accomplishing the objectives appear in a single line.

- Resist the urge to copy and paste code from the lessons.  The process of typing, especially in an interactive environment, presents a powerful learning experience.

- Reach out for help/advice as best fits your learning style.  My advice is to struggle a bit with new material - that's important to making it your own - but don't struggle to the point of frustration.  Have no fear that I'll give you the answer.  I can, however, provide pointers, suggestions, and clues that can break the logjam and get you moving toward solution.

Above all, have fun.  This is powerful and interesting material and can be savored as such.

Good Luck!

-Pat
