**Here are your instructions:**
Modify the logic of the Tree object to :
provide a find() method that locates a key (whose value is passed to find() as an argument) and returns the data associated with the node; if the key is not present in the tree, the method should raise a KeyError exception.

Hi Mark,

You did an awesome job putting your Tree together. It's a really good skill to have as this is the fundamental way a lot of data is stored.

Good work.
