**Question 1:**
What is the difference between extending a superclass' method and overriding a superclass' method?

**Your Answer:**
When you extend a superclass' method(s), you use inheritance to obtain all of the superclass' methods, and then enhance the method(s) you need with extra functionality and delegate the rest to the superclass' methods.

When you override a superclass' method(s), you basically create a completely new type of object some of whose methods you may bind to a superclass' methods, other methods of the same name as in the superclass may do something quite different.
