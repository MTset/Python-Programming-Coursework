**Here are your instructions:**
Write a program that imports a module and then goes through the module's namespace to find any functions and print the names of the functions and their arguments, in the same way as it might appear in a def statement.

Example output:
'def dump(obj, fp, skipkeys=False, ensure_ascii=True, check_circular=True, allow_nan=True, cls=None, indent=None, separators=None, default=None, **kw)'
'def dumps(obj, skipkeys=False, ensure_ascii=True, check_circular=True, allow_nan=True, cls=None, indent=None, separators=None, default=None, **kw)'
'def load(fp, cls=None, object_hook=None, parse_float=None, parse_int=None, parse_constant=None, object_pairs_hook=None, **kw)'
'def loads(s, encoding=None, cls=None, object_hook=None, parse_float=None, parse_int=None, parse_constant=None, object_pairs_hook=None, **kw)'

**Your Comment:**
Hi Pat,

An interesting exercise, this one.  Took twice as long to get the test to run properly as it did to
code the module :-)

Have a great day!

Cheers,

Hi Mark,

I totally understand what you are saying here. It's true that the ratio of testing time to coding the main app can seem a little bit out of whack in these courses. That's mostly because you have never seen the coding your main app for, and will likely never see it again. Also, these small projects are meant to focus on specific skills or knowledge with laserlike contents and have relatively few lines of code. 

One of the ways you might have taken a shortcut would be to create your own module. It could have a couple of simple methods. The tests would be much easier to write and it would be a "better practice", anyway, because I wouldn't have to do research on an unfamiliar module in order to check that your program works.

Anyway, good job here, and best wishes for a terrific Thanksgiving.

-Pat
