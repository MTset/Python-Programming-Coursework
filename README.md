# Python-Programming-Coursework
O'Reilly School of Technology - Python Programming Certificate
--------------------------------------------------------------

The Python Programming certificate series was comprised of four courses covering beginning to advanced Python using Test Driven Development. Courses were delivered using both the CodeRunner and Eclipse-based Ellipse learning IDE.

* Upon completion of this certificate program, I was able to:

* Create Python scripts that use expressions, variables, conditionals, loops, lists, sets, dicts, functions, objects and exceptions.

* Develop Python applications that utilize file handling, pickling and archiving (zip and tar).

* Utilize Python to interact with SQL databases.

* Implement email objects.

* Utilize profiling to describe run-time performance of my programs and learn how to optimize my code.

* Create/Develop generators and decorators.

* Utilize introspection, multi-threading, and multi-processing techniques.

Upon completion I earned a Certificate of Professional Development.  This forms my initial professional portfolio in Python.
